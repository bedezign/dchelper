# Docker Compose Helper

**(STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, use at your own risk)**

> Please note that most functionality in this helper **only works on macOS**.
I'm really sorry about that. I would love to help Windows people as well,
but fact is that it simply does not support most of the required functionality.

If you use docker compose and you want to be able to develop using a decent url for your project like *http://myproject.test*  instead of *http://127.0.0.1:32721* with nearly no extra setup, then read on!

This tool wraps around docker-compose and will be ran instead of it so it can add some exiting new functionality to your development environment.

Please note that this script **will need sudo** rights for some of the commands.

## Installing

You can simply add it via packagist/composer:

```
composer global require bedezign/dchelper
```

After that you might want to setup an alias in your `.bashrc` file:
```
alias docker-compose="php ~/.composer/bin/dchelper"
```


It's as easy as that!

If you always want to trigger it in `sudo` mode, you can just add `sudo` before it. That's not a requirement however, your password will be asked for when needed.

## What does it do?

In short:

 - Provides you with a "dedicated IP" for your project (instead of `127.0.0.1`)
 - Get rid of having to specify ports
 - Automatically create/maintain a hostname for your project. Use [myproject.test](myproject.test) in your browser instead of an IP!
 - Easily "shell" into a container.
 - All of this via environment variables (`.env) or docker-compose.yml settings.


### Ports, ports, ports!

When publishing a port from a container, by default the docker VM maps this onto your `localhost` (`127.0.0.1`).

If you don't specify a remote port, you won't get port collisions but you'll end up with some obscure port like `32122`.
I don't know about you, but hosting my development site at `http(s)://127.0.0.1:32122` just doesn't seem right.
Even assigning a host to it doesn't make it any prettier when you always have to specify a port.

The alternative would be to map it to the default remote port, but then you'll probably end up with "port in use" etc.

Docker actually has its own solution for this and DCHelper adds a second one.

The premise is that we can add an extra virtual IP per docker-compose-project.
That would mean that heavily used ports like 80 and 443 are always available on "your" IP.

There is already a solution built-in in your OS: Linux (and by extension macOS) allow you to add "virtual" IPs to your loopback network interface (aka IP alias).
Both docker and `dchelper` can use this functionality to simplify your life a bit.

### Remote IPs (docker)

Docker (and Docker Compose) define a port specification as follows: `[[remote_ip:]remote_port[-remote_port]:]port[/protocol]`

This means that, when you are adding a published port, you can also specify the IP on which you want the port to be added:

```
container:
  ports:
    - 172.99.0.6:80:80
```

So the above tells docker to link service port `80` to port `80` on IP `172.99.0.6` (instead of `127.0.0.1`).
Pretty awesome no? There is a small gotcha however: `docker-compose` will not add the aliased IP to your network interface.

DCHelper will.

It interprets the docker-compose config in advance (as well as your `.env` if one was found) and determines what IPs need to be aliased for your configuration to work.

If it finds any that don't exist yet, it will register them for you before passing control to docker-compose.

Using this functionality is easy: The only modification needed to your configuration is what was shown in the example above.

More extensive example:

`.env`:
```
COMPOSE_ALIAS_IP=172.99.0.1
```

`docker-compose.yml`:
```
services:
  db:
   ports:
      - ${COMPOSE_ALIAS_IP}:3306:3306
      
  nginx:
    ports:
      - ${COMPOSE_ALIAS_IP}:80:80
```

By using a configured value you don't have much work to update the IP later on.
Since the variable will be replaced by docker-compose, DCHelper will still pick up the actual IPs.

`COMPOSE_ALIAS_IP` has a special meaning: DCHelper will always alias this IP, even if it wasn't used further in your configuration.
The variable is also used by the **hosts** functionality.

This means slightly more in your configuration file, but docker takes care of the rest, no external utilities needed.

### TCP Proxying/Tunneling (via socat)

This functionality uses [`socat` (SOcket CAT)](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat.html), which is a pretty awesome tool that describes itself as a "Multipurpose relay".
(It can be easily installed on a mac via HomeBrew)

For this variant your ports-configuration remains as is:
```
container:
  ports:
    - 80
```

The trick here is that you either add a global `COMPOSE_PROXY_IP` environment variable, or specify a `PROXY_IP` in the containers' environment:

```
container:
  ports:
    - 80
  environment:
    PROXY_IP: 172.99.0.1  
```

(Specifying `PROXY_IP` allows you to use different IPs in your setup. Use the `COMPOSE_PROXY_IP` globally if you only need the one IP.)

When parsing the configuration, DCHelper will detect all published ports and where they are linked to.
It will then launch a bunch of `socat` instances to establish a tunnel between the proxy IP and the randomly assigned docker port on `127.0.0.1`.

The net effect will be the same as the "Remote IP"-method, so it depends on what you prefer.
The disadvantage here is that this only works if you detach from the containers when running the `up` command.
The tunneling can only be done after your "up" command finalises (containers need to be running to detect the configuration), which doesn't happen without `-d`

This example yields an identical result:

`.env`:
```
COMPOSE_PROXY_IP=172.99.0.1
```
`docker-compose.yml`:
```
services:
  db:
   ports:
      - 3306
      
  nginx:
    ports:
      - 80
```

Both port `3306` and `80` will be available via `172.99.0.1`.

As mentioned above: It is possible to use different IPs per service, just use `PROXY_IP` instead.

## Hostnames

By adding a `COMPOSE_HOSTNAME` to your environment, you tell DCHelper to check your `/etc/hosts` file and if needed, add a new entry to it.
The IP used will be either `COMPOSE_ALIAS_IP` or, if that wasn't set, `COMPOSE_PROXY_IP`.

There is currently no support for a per service/container host, just the global one.
(I'll add this if someone requests it, I currently have no need for it)

## Shell

DCHelper adds a `shell`-command. By doing `dchelper shell php` for example, it will trigger a (login) shell for in the related container.
This actually runs `docker exec -it <container> bash -l` in the background, but it will allow you to specify the compose service name instead of having to figure out the docker container name.

By using `COMPOSE_SHELL_DEFAULT=service-name` in your environment you can indicate what service to use if none was specified.
This can also be done by adding `SHELL_DEFAULT=1` to one of your service environment definitions.

If you have a terminal application that understands escape sequences (like iTerm2), DCHelper can also change the tab title for you.
You can either specify a title per service in the services environment using `SHELL_TITLE` or specify a global format via `COMPOSE_SHELL_TITLE`. In this case `{CONTAINER}` will be replaced by the containers' name.

For example: `COMPOSE_SHELL_TITLE="${COMPOSE_HOSTNAME: {CONTAINER}"`. The hostname replacement will be taken care of by docker compose, the `{CONTAINER}` will be replace by DCHelper.
